# I'm moving to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/gstaaij)

With every new commit to a public repository, I will move that repository to Codeberg (with a few exceptions, probably).

## My Codeberg repos

- [testflight-searcher](https://codeberg.org/gstaaij/testflight-searcher): A utility for downloading IPAs and icons from the TestFlight "TeraLeak" WARC files.
